## The name's Matsuo (*Momiji*)
Obviously, my real name *isn't* Matsuo, but it's what everyone in the Internet knows me as. I'm a Filipino college student in the University of Santo Tomas (*not the University of **Saint** Thomas; There's a difference*) currently taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Web Development. 

Why did I tell you that? Because, with some effort, you can easily track down my real name and identity (*yippee*) using the good ol' internet. Though I'd like to believe that I can have some form of control over my privacy by not saying my name firsthand.

Take me out for a dinner before sending a pipe bomb to my house, as the saying goes.
## Why am I here?
Well, I don't know why *you're* here, but I'm here to post coding projects that I think of. And I don't think of a lot. Adding to that, most of what I think of are really shit, and have already been done to oblivion. 

But yet, here we are...
## Can I use your code?
First of all, why?

Second, yes. If for some reason you find some use for my code, I give my explicit permission for you to use it unless stated otherwise in the repository. 
## Contact Information
You can contact me at my email at mushtroqua@gmail.com for any inquiries, questions, etc. Though do expect for me to answer after a day or so as I might be busy, or have not noticed your email.

If you have access to my Discord, or any of my other emails, then please also contact me there though at that point, looking for my contact information is already moot (*Seeing as we may already know each other IRL, or have already contacted me at that point*)
